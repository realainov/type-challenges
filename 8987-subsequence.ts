  ### Question
  
  Given an array of unique elements, return all possible subsequences.
  
  A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
  
  For example: 
  
  ```typescript
  type A = Subsequence<[1, 2]> // [] | [1] | [2] | [1, 2]
  ```

/* _____________ Your Code Here _____________ */

type Subsequence<T extends any[]> = T extends [infer F, ...infer R]
    ? Subsequence<R> | [F, ...Subsequence<R>]
    : [];

/* _____________ Test Cases _____________ */
import type { Equal, Expect } from '@type-challenges/utils';

type cases = [
    Expect<Equal<Subsequence<[1, 2]>, [] | [1] | [2] | [1, 2]>>,
    Expect<Equal<Subsequence<[1, 2, 3]>, [] | [1] | [2] | [1, 2] | [3] | [1, 3] | [2, 3] | [1, 2, 3]>>
];
